Windows Service for Database Backup

In this project, I created a Windows service that automatically backups a database in the background. I used IHostedService and BackgroundService to automate the process of backup. The main goal of this project is to understand how Windows services works and implement a simple solution for automate database backups.

The service periodically connects to the database and creates a backup file with a timestamp, saving it in a specified location. The backup process works without any user interaction, letting the service run continously in the background.

 How to Set Up a Windows Service for Database Backup on Windows
1. Publish the Application
To get your application ready for deployment as a Windows service, you need to publish it first. Use the following command in your terminal, ensuring you're in the project directory:


dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish --runtime win-x64 

2. Create the Windows Service
Once the application is published, open PowerShell as Administrator and use the following command to create a Windows service:

sc.exe create "DbBackupWindowsService" binPath= "\"C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe\" \"C:\path\to\your\published\DbBackupWindowsService.dll\""
Important Notes:

Replace C:\path\to\your\published\DbBackupWindowsService.dll with the actual path to the DbBackupWindowsService.dll file in the ./publish folder you just created.
The dotnet.exe is the .NET runtime, so it's required to run your .dll file.
Be sure to check that all paths are correct and there are no typos.
